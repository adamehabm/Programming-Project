# Project
This is my 3rd term applied programming that i made last semester, where i was tasked with creating a mini 2d game using a library created by my profesor.
I opted to create a game called "catch the falling apple" where a bucket is controlled by the user using left and right arrows to try and catch as many apples as possible with lives and a score counter as well.
